Authentication and Authorization Project

Overview

This project implements a secure backend system for user authentication and authorization. It uses JWT for session management, bcrypt for password hashing, and PostgreSQL as the database. The application is built using Node.js and Express, with environment variables managed by dotenv.

Features

User Authentication: Register and login functionality with password hashing.

Session Management: JWT-based token handling for secure user sessions.

Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC).

Secure Cookie Handling: Uses cookie-parser for managing cookies.

Environment Configuration: Centralized configuration with .env.

Requirements

Node.js: >= 14.x

PostgreSQL: >= 13.x

npm: >= 6.x

Installation

Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd auth

Install Dependencies

npm install

Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=<your-db-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-db-password>
DB_NAME=<your-db-name>
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>

Start the Application

In development mode:

npm run dev

In production mode:

npm start

Dependencies

bcrypt: Password hashing

cookie-parser: Parse HTTP cookies

dotenv: Environment variable management

express: Web framework

jsonwebtoken: JWT token creation and verification

pg: PostgreSQL client for Node.js

nodemon (dev): Development tool for auto-restarting the server

API Endpoints

User Authentication

RegisterPOST /api/auth/registerBody:

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

LoginPOST /api/auth/loginBody:

{
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}

LogoutPOST /api/auth/logout

Protected Routes

All protected routes require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

Example: Authorization: Bearer <token>

Security Best Practices

Store JWT Secrets Securely: Keep JWT_SECRET confidential.

Use HTTPS: Ensure the application runs over HTTPS in production.

Sanitize Inputs: Prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.

Hash Passwords: Use bcrypt for password hashing.

Future Improvements

Add rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

Enhance role-based access control for more granular permissions.

Implement email verification for user registration.
